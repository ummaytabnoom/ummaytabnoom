i’m learning **C programming** and **Data Structures & Algorithms**, slowly and gently.  
i practice loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and basic DSA like linked lists, stacks, and queues.  
still a beginner, still curious, still trying every day ☕💻  

this GitHub is my learning diary messy code, small wins, and steady progress.  
i’m here to grow, not to be perfect 🌸
